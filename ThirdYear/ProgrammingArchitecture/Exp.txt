Sure! To write assembly code for calculating the sum of an arithmetic progression (AP) where the user inputs the first term (`a1`), the common difference (`d`), and the number of terms (`n`), we need to:

1. Read the values of `a1`, `d`, and `n` from the user.
2. Calculate the sum of the arithmetic progression using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times [2 \times a1 + (n - 1) \times d]
   \]
3. Print the result.

Here is a sample NASM assembly code for a 32-bit x86 environment using macros for I/O operations. Note that the exact syntax for macros like `GET_DEC` and `PRINT_DEC` will depend on the definitions provided in the `io.inc` file, so you'll need to adjust these macros based on your actual `io.inc`.

### Assembly Code

```asm
%include "io.inc"

section .bss
    a1 resd 1          ; Reserve space for the first term
    d  resd 1           ; Reserve space for the common difference
    n  resd 1           ; Reserve space for the number of terms
    sum resd 1          ; Reserve space for the sum

section .text
global main

main:
    mov ebp, esp       ; Set up the stack frame

    ; Get input for the first term (a1)
    GET_DEC 4, eax     ; Read first term into eax
    mov [a1], eax      ; Store the first term in memory

    ; Get input for the common difference (d)
    GET_DEC 4, eax     ; Read common difference into eax
    mov [d], eax       ; Store the common difference in memory

    ; Get input for the number of terms (n)
    GET_DEC 4, eax     ; Read number of terms into eax
    mov [n], eax       ; Store the number of terms in memory

    ; Load values into registers for calculation
    mov eax, [a1]      ; Load a1 into eax
    mov ebx, [d]       ; Load d into ebx
    mov ecx, [n]       ; Load n into ecx

    ; Calculate (n - 1) * d
    dec ecx            ; ecx = n - 1
    imul ebx, ecx      ; ebx = (n - 1) * d

    ; Calculate 2 * a1
    shl eax, 1         ; eax = 2 * a1

    ; Add 2 * a1 + (n - 1) * d
    add eax, ebx       ; eax = 2 * a1 + (n - 1) * d

    ; Calculate n / 2
    mov edx, 0         ; Clear edx for division
    div dword [n]      ; eax = eax / n, result in eax

    ; Calculate sum = (n / 2) * (2 * a1 + (n - 1) * d)
    mov [sum], eax     ; Store the result in memory

    ; Print the result
    PRINT_DEC 4, [sum] ; Print the result

    ; Print newline
    NEWLINE

    ; Exit
    xor eax, eax       ; Set eax to 0 (return value)
    ret
```

### Explanation

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `section .bss` is used to reserve space for variables. We use `resd 1` to reserve space for each variable (`a1`, `d`, `n`, and `sum`).

2. **Input Reading**:
   - `GET_DEC 4, eax` reads a 32-bit integer from the user and stores it in `eax`. We then move this value into the corresponding memory location.

3. **Arithmetic Calculations**:
   - We load values into registers and perform the necessary arithmetic operations:
     - Compute `(n - 1) * d`.
     - Compute `2 * a1`.
     - Compute `2 * a1 + (n - 1) * d`.
     - Divide the result by `n` to get the sum of the arithmetic progression.

4. **Printing the Result**:
   - `PRINT_DEC 4, [sum]` prints the calculated sum.
   - `NEWLINE` prints a newline character for formatting.

5. **Exit**:
   - `xor eax, eax` clears the `eax` register to return `0`.
   - `ret` returns from the `main` function.

### Notes

- Make sure the `io.inc` file defines the macros `GET_DEC`, `PRINT_DEC`, and `NEWLINE` correctly to handle user input and output operations.
- If you are using a different architecture or assembly environment, adjust the instructions and macros as needed.
